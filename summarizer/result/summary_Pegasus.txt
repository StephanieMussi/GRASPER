The performance of general category discovery on fine-grained data can be improved by exploiting self-supervised representations of irrelevant class-irrelevant cues, as we have shown in our previous work [1, 2]. 2 Related Works 2.1 Novel Category Discovery Novel Category Discovery (NCD) aims to discover new categories by transferring the knowledge learned from a set of relevant but different seen classes to a new object, then further fine-tuned using a pair-wise loss on unLabeled data, as we have shown in our previous work [1, 2], and in our present work. In our series of papers on non-labeling (NCD) classification, we have shown that a number of approaches to this problem, such as MixUp and local object parts, have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as instance discrimination and DualRank, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as Contrastive learning, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as DualRank, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as Contrastive learning, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as DualRank, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as Contrastive learning, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as DualRank, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as Contrastive learning, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as DualRank, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen This paper presents a framework for contrastive learning on the GCD training dataset D1...DK as well as on the full dataset D0. Each of the partitioned sub-datasets model to learn fine-supervised discriminative information on the background because the examples will need to learn the difference on the objects to be able to distinguish the examples. The training dataset D1...DK has been used to train a model to learn fine-grained discriminative information on the background because the examples will need to learn the difference on the objects to be able to distinguish the examples. In this paper, we propose a semi-Supervised GCD model that learns fine-grained discriminative features by combining supervised contrastive losses with supervised contrastive losses in a minibatch of unlabelled images, and then reassigns the labels to the correct cluster based on the new labels in the minibatch, as in the original k-means method [1, 2]), and then computes the supervised contrastive losses in the minibatch as well as the supervised contrastive losses in the original k-means method, which are defined as Ls i =  1 |N(i)|  qN(i) log exp(zi zq/) n 1[n=i] exp(zi zn/) (2) where N(i) is the set of indices of images in the minibatch that have the same label yi with the anchor image i. In this paper, we propose a coarse-grained discriminative training model for image recognition based on a set of expert sub-datasets, each of which is dedicated to learning fine-grained discriminative features from each of the sub-dataset's corresponding images. Specifically, our proposed fine-grained self-supervised contrastive loss is Lu fine =  K  kgrained 1 |Bk|  iBk log exp(hk(vi)hk( vi)/) (4) where Bk is a minibatch of images sampled from a partitioned dataset Dk, vi and  vi are two views of one same image through data augmentation, and  is the temperature parameter. In this paper, we propose a coarse-grained feature learning method to learn fine-grained features from image classification datasets, with a special focus on the performance of the fine- grained image clas- sification datasets, which can be more challenging for GCD methods requiring models to learn highly discriminative features [23,24,25,27,28,29,30,31,32,33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 51, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 80, 81, 83, 84, 87, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 98, 99, 103, 104, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, In this paper, we present a semi-supervised method for fine-tuning image classifi- cation methods using ViT-B-16 as the backbone, and we compare it with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results.
