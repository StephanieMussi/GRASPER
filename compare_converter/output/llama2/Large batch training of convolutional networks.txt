Slide 1: Introduction and Background
Title: Overview of Large Batch Training in CNNs
Content:
* Acceleration of CNN training relies on increasing computational resources, specifically data-parallel SGD with mini-batches divided among multiple units.
* Larger batch sizes often result in decreased model accuracy, a challenge documented in numerous studies.

Slide 2: The Challenges of Large Batch Training
Title: Impact on Model Accuracy and Optimization Difficulties
Content:
* Studies indicate that training with large batches tends to reduce model accuracy due to fewer iterations for weight updates, which necessitates larger steps in the learning rate.
* Using a larger LR can lead to optimization difficulties, especially during initial training phases.

Slide 3: Proposed Solutions and New Developments
Title: Batch Normalization and Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS)
Content:
* Batch normalization replaces Local Response Normalization layers in AlexNet to improve model convergence for large learning rates and accuracy.
* LARS adjusts the LR for each layer individually based on the norm of layer weights and gradient updates, offering a more stable and controlled training progression.

Slide 4: Analysis of LARS Algorithm
Title: Mechanism and Benefits of LARS
Content:
* LARS uses separate LRs for each layer, not just each weight, controlling the update magnitude in relation to weight norm for more stable and controlled training progression.
* Main advantages include better stability and capacity to train networks like Alexnet and Resnet-50 at very large batch sizes without accuracy loss.

Slide 5: Experimental Results and Findings
Title: Alexnet and Resnet-50 Training with LARS
Content:
* Alexnet-BN showed improved accuracy across various large batch sizes compared to standard Alexnet, especially notable at 8K and 16K batch sizes.
* Resnet-50 was successfully scaled up to a batch size of 32K with minimal accuracy loss using LARS.

Slide 6: Conclusion and Implications
Title: Summary of Contributions and Future Research Directions
Content:
* LARS represents a significant advancement in the training of CNNs with large batches, addressing many of the key challenges associated with traditional methods.
* Future research directions include exploring the generalization gap and potential improvements in large batch training techniques.
