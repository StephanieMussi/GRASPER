 Slide 1
Title: Introduction to Version Incompatibility in Deep Learning
Content:
- Version incompatibility issues hinder DL model development and application
- Current solutions limited to Python packages and declared dependencies
- Proposed study utilizes Stack Overflow data for enhanced detection capabilities

Slide 2
Title: Problem Statement: Version Incompatibility Detection Challenge
Content:
- Complex dependencies within DL development stack
- Extracting actionable knowledge from unstructured text on Stack Overflow
- Identifying explicit and implicit dependency issues

Slide 3
Title: Methodology: The "Decide" System
Content:
- Utilizes QA model UnifiedQA to interpret Stack Overflow texts
- Constructs a knowledge graph of compatibility relationships
- Identifies version constraints and required components from DL projects
- Matches requirements against the knowledge graph for incompatibility detection
- Dynamically updates the knowledge graph with new information

Slide 4
Title: Evaluation Results
Content:
- Detected 65% of known version issues with 92% precision
- Significantly outperforms existing techniques
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of using crowd-sourced knowledge and NLP techniques

Slide 5
Title: Contributions of the Study
Content:
- Novel approach to detect version incompatibility using crowd-sourced knowledge
- Application of a QA model for extracting structured knowledge from unstructured data
- Creation of a large-scale publicly available knowledge graph of version compatibility relations

Slide 6
Title: Future Work
Content:
- Incorporating more diverse data sources
- Extending the approach to other programming environments and ecosystems
- Automating the repair of detected incompatibilities for enhanced productivity and software robustness
