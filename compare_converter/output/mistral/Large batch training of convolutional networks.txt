 Slide 1
Title: Introduction and Background
Content:
- Overview of the challenge of increasing computational resources in CNN training
- Problem statement: Decreased model accuracy with larger batch sizes
- Current solutions: Adjusting learning rate (LR) and its limitations

Slide 2
Title: Challenges of Large Batch Training
Content:
- Impact on Model Accuracy: Fewer iterations for weight updates, requiring larger LR steps
- Optimization Difficulties: Complicates optimization and can lead to divergence
- Case studies: Resnet-50 and Alexnet

Slide 3
Title: Proposed Solutions and New Developments
Content:
- Batch Normalization (BN): Improves model convergence for large learning rates and accuracy
- Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS): A novel training algorithm that adjusts the LR for each layer

Slide 4
Title: Mechanism of LARS Algorithm
Content:
- Separate LR for each layer, not just each weight
- Controls update magnitude in relation to weight norm

Slide 5
Title: Benefits of LARS Algorithm
Content:
- Better stability
- Capacity to train networks like Alexnet and Resnet-50 at large batch sizes (up to 32K) without accuracy loss

Slide 6
Title: Performance Comparison of LARS vs. Traditional Methods
Content:
- Significantly outperforms traditional methods in training stability and effectiveness, especially noticeable in higher batch sizes

Slide 7
Title: Experimental Results and Findings
Content:
- Alexnet-BN Training: Improved accuracy with LARS compared to standard Alexnet
- Resnet-50 Scaling: Successfully scaled up to a batch size of 32K with minimal accuracy loss
- Generalization and Stability: Conclusion that accuracy loss is primarily due to optimization issues rather than lack of generalization capability
