 Slide 1
Title: Introduction to XCon: Addressing Generalized Category Discovery in Fine-Grained Datasets
Content:
- Unlabeled datasets with both seen and unseen classes pose a challenge in fine-grained category discovery.
- Need for models that can make sense of new, unlabeled data using limited labeled data as reference.

Slide 2
Title: Problem Definition: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)
Content:
- Learning to identify subtle distinctions between similar categories with limited labeled data.
- Differentiated from semi-supervised learning due to lack of comprehensive class labels in training data.

Slide 3
Title: XCon Method: Two-Phase Learning Process
Content:
1. Data Partitioning: Divide dataset into expert sub-datasets using k-means clustering on self-supervised representations based on class-irrelevant cues.
2. Expert-Contrastive Learning: Employ contrastive learning in each sub-dataset to focus on class-relevant features and learn fine-grained differences.
