Slide 1: Introduction
Title: Generalized Category Discovery and XCon
Content:
* Introduces a novel approach to address the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) in computer vision tasks.
Slide 2: Related Works
Title: Overview of Novel Category Discovery and Contrastive Learning
Content:
* Earlier works in NCD have utilized transfer learning and self-supervision techniques to categorize unseen classes based on knowledge transferred from seen classes.
Slide 3: Methodology
Title: Partitioning the Dataset using k-means Clustering
Content:
* XCon partitions the dataset into several sub-datasets (referred to as expert datasets) using k-means clustering on self-supervised representations.
Slide 4: Learning Process
Title: Dual Approach to Learning - Supervised and Unsupervised Contrastive Learning
Content:
* XCon learns from both coarse-grained (overall dataset) and fine-grained (sub-dataset) features through a dual approach that combines supervised and unsupervised contrastive learning across the full dataset and within the sub-datasets.
Slide 5: Experiments and Results
Title: XCon Achieves State-of-the-Art Performance on Fine-Grained Category Discovery Benchmarks
Content:
* The effectiveness of XCon was evaluated on various datasets, including CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-100, CUB-200, Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and Oxford-IIIT Pet. These datasets encompass a wide range of classification challenges, from generic to fine-grained categories. XCon achieved state-of-the-art performance on several fine-grained category discovery benchmarks, demonstrating its capability to enhance classification performance significantly in challenging datasets.
Slide 6: Ablation Studies
Title: Validating the Effectiveness of XCon Components
Content:
* Ablation studies were conducted to validate the effectiveness of various components of XCon, including the impact of the weight of fine-grained loss and the number of sub-datasets. These studies confirmed the robustness of the XCon approach across different configurations and provided insights into optimal settings for different datasets.
Slide 7: Conclusion
Title: XCon - A Novel Approach to Fine-Grained Category Discovery
Content:
* Introduces a novel method for fine-grained category discovery by leveraging expert sub-datasets and a combination of contrastive learning approaches. Its success across various benchmarks signifies a significant advancement in the field, offering a new direction for research in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning within fine-grained classification scenarios.
