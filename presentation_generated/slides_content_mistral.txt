 Slide 1: Introduction to Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)
Title: GCD: Leveraging Labeled Data for Unlabeled Instance Categorization
Content: With the advance of deep learning, progress in computer vision tasks relies heavily on large-scale annotated data. However, collecting and annotating such datasets for fine-grained recognition tasks is challenging due to expertise required and new classes emerging continuously. GCD proposes a solution by utilizing labeled datasets to categorize unlabeled instances based on implicit criteria set by the labeled data.

Slide 2: Motivation and Related Works
Title: Motivation: Challenges in Fine-Grained Category Discovery
Content: Traditional methods struggle with large inter-class similarities and intra-class variances, leading to suboptimal performance due to irrelevant cues. Novel Category Discovery (NCD) has been proposed as an alternative, but its effectiveness in fine-grained classification is limited.

Slide 3: XCon Methodology
Title: XCon: Expert-Contrastive Learning for Fine-Grained GCD
