 Slide 1: Introduction to Generalized Category Discovery (GCD)
Title: GCD: Leveraging Labeled Data for Unlabeled Fine-Grained Recognition
Content: With deep learning progress, computer vision tasks have made significant strides. However, collecting and annotating large datasets for fine-grained recognition remains a challenge. GCD is proposed as an alternative to semi-supervised learning, focusing on using labeled data to categorize unlabeled instances based on implicit criteria.

Slide 2: Motivation and Related Work
Title: Motivation: Challenges in Fine-Grained Category Discovery
Content: Traditional methods struggle with large inter-class similarities and intra-class variances, leading to suboptimal performance. Novel Category Discovery (NCD) and Contrastive Learning are related approaches, but their effectiveness in fine-grained classification is limited.

Slide 3: XCon Methodology
Title: XCon: Expert-Contrastive Learning for Fine-Grained GCD
Content: XCon partitions the dataset into expert datasets using k-means clustering on self-supervised representations, allowing the model to learn finer distinctions between classes. Dual learning with supervised and unsupervised contrastive losses is employed.
