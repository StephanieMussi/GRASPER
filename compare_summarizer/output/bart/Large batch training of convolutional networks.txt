We propose a novel algorithm for large batch training of convolutional networks. Using Layer-wise Adaptive AdaptiveRate Scaling (LARS), we scaled Alexnet up to a batch size of 8K, and Resnet-50 to abatch size of 32K without loss in accuracy. LARS improved both model convergence and accuracy for large networks as well as accuracy. We will refer to this modification of AlexNet as AlexNet-BN-BN throughout the rest of the paper.

The training of CNN is done using Stochastic Gradient (SG) based methods. LARS uses a separate learning rate for each layer and not for each weight, which leads to better stability. The magnitude of the update is controlled with respect to the weight norm for better control of training speed. With LARS we trained Alexnet-BN and Resnet-50 with B=32K without accuracy loss. We tried a few methods to improve the generalization with data augmentation and warm-up, but they did not find a generalization that could be applied to large data sets. The main obstacle for scaling up batch is the instability of training with high LR. To overcome the instability during initial phase, Goyal et al. (2017)proposed to use LRwarm-up: training starts with small LR, and then LR is gradually increased to the target. After the warm up period (usually a few epochs), you switch to the regular LR policy. Using warmup and linear scaling Goyal and Goyal-trained Resnet 50 with batch B=8K without loss in accuracy. These recipes constitute the recipes for large-state-of-the-art training for CNN. We hope to use them as the starting point of our training experiments with small data sets with a small data set with a learning rate of 1.5%. The current state of the current training experiment with CNN is called "generalization gap", by Keskar and Keskar. We used BVLC1 Alexnet with batch B=512 as baseline. Model was trained using SGD with momentum 0.9 with initial LR=0.01 and the polynomial (power=2) decay LR policy for 100 epochs. With BN we could use large LR-s even without warm-up. For B=4K the best accuracy 58.9% was achieved for LR= 0.18, and for B=8K thebest accuracy 58% was achieve for LR =0.3. We also observed that BN significantly widen the range of LRs with good accuracy. Still there is a 2.2% accuracy loss for B =8K. To check if it is related to the "generalization gap" we looked at the loss gap between training and testing. We conclude that the accuracy loss is not related to a generalization gap, and it is caused by the low training. We found that the ratio of the L2-norm of weights and gradients of gradients can become larger than the L1/L2 ratio. When the large L2/L1 ratio is larger, the large LR can become more accurate than the base L2. This can cause the initial phase of training to be highly sensitive to the weight initialization and initial weights of the training layers. We will refer to this model as Alexnet-BN 3. AlexNet-BN can be used to train deep learning networks. The network is trained using LARS, a type of convolutional network. LARS is used to create layers with different weights and biases. We use local LR for each layer, which can be extended for weight decay. We also use momentum and polynomial LR decay to create a stochastic gradient for the current mini-batch.

We re-trained Alexnet and Alexnet-BN with LARS for batches up to 32K 6. For B=8K the accuracy of both networks matched the baseline B=512. The local LR strongly depends on the layer and batch size (see Figure. 2 ) 5 One can consider LARS as a private case of block-diagonal re-scaling from Lafond et al. (2017) 6. We found that the same networks can be trained with almost the same accuracy as the baseline. We trained with the minimal data augmentation (pre-scale images to 256x256 and use random 224x224 crop with horizontal flip). During testing we used one model and 1 central crop. The state-of-the-art accuracy 75% was achieved with more extensive data. augmentation during testing and with multi-crop testing. For more details see log files and log files from Berkeley.edu/publications/yang/publication.16/Publications.16. Scaling of LARS with Resnet-50, ver.1 from He et. (2016) with Lars. 7. As a baseline we used B=256with corresponding top-1 accuracy 73%. 7. We used one models and one central crop to test the network. 8. We tested the network with the same baseline as the base LRs from [13;22] for example, for B=32k, LRS from [17,28] give the accuracy 57.5%. Large batch is a key for scaling up training of convolutional networks. The existing approach for large-batch training, based on using large learning rates, leads to divergence, especially during the initial phase, even with learning rate warm-up. To solve these optimization difficulties we proposed the new algorithm, which adapts the learning rate for each layer (LARS) Using LARS, we extended the scaling of Alexnet and Resnet-50 to B=32K. Training of these networks with batch above 32K without accuracy loss is still open problem. We argue that when batch very large, the stochastic gradients become very close to true Carbunclegradients. We propose a new algorithm to close the gen-geniceralization gap in large batch training of neural networks. We conclude by saying that the accuracy can be recovered completely by just training                longer. Back to Mail Online home.Back to the page you came from..
