The proposed method, called XCon, leverages expert knowledge to improve the performance of contrastive learning on unlabeled data. Specifically, XCon partitions the dataset into k   In this paper, the authors propose XCon, a method for generalized category discovery with fine-grained image classification benchmarks. XCon partitions the dataset into K sub-datasets using k-means clustering on a self-supervised representation, and each partitioned sub-dataset is used   The paper proposes a method for fine-grained category discovery, which involves learning a representation of images that captures their semantic meaning. The proposed method uses a contrastive learning framework, where an unsupervised classification loss is combined with a supervised contrastive loss to learn a robust representation.

The paper presents a new approach to fine-grained recognition, which involves training a deep neural network to distinguish between different categories of objects at the level of individual features. The authors propose a contrastive loss function that encourages the network to learn a robust representation of the input data, and demonstrate its effectiveness on several benchmark datasets. They also perform an ablation study to analyze the contribution of different components of their approach.
The key findings of the paper are:
* The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several fine-grained recognition tasks, outperforming traditional supervised learning methods.
* The contrastive loss function is essential for the network to learn a robust representation of the input data.
* The balanced parameter Î» = 0.35 is found to be optimal for the contrastive loss function.
* An ablation study shows that the network's performance improves as the amount of unsupervised contrastive learning increases.
Overall, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlights its potential for improving fine-grained recognition in various applications.
