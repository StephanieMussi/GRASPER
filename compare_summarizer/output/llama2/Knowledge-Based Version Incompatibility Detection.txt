The paper discusses the problem of dependency hell in deep learning, which refers to the issue of incompatible dependencies between different libraries and frameworks used in deep learning applications. The authors propose a novel approach called Dependency Hell Problem (DHP) to address this issue by identifying and resolving conflicts between dependencies in a modular and efficient manner. They also introduce a new metric called Dependency Hell Score (DHS) to evaluate the severity of dependency conflicts and provide insights into the impact of these conflicts on deep learning models.
The authors conducted an extensive evaluation of their approach using real-world deep learning projects and found that DHP can effectively identify and resolve dependency conflicts, leading to improved model performance and reduced risk of errors. They also compared their approach with existing methods and showed that it outperforms them in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
Finally, the authors conclude that DHP is a valuable tool for deep learning practitioners and researchers to manage dependencies and improve model performance, and they provide recommendations for future work in this area.
