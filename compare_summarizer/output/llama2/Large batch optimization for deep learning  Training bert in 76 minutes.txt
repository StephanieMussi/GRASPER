The tables present the accuracy information of tuning AdamW optimizer for ImageNet training with ResNet-50. The learning rate recipe used is from Goyal et al. (2017) and includes a 5-epoch warmup and multiplying the learning rate by 0.1 at epochs 30, 60, and 80. The target accuracy is around 0.763. The tables show the Top-1 validation accuracy for each epoch, with the learning rate and weight decay parameters varied. The best performance was achieved at epoch 50 with a learning rate of 0.009765625 and weight decay of 0.0002.
