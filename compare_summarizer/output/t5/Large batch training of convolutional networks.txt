training of large convolutional networks takes a lot of time. we propose a new training algorithm based on Layer-wise Adaptive Rate Scaling (LARS) using LARS, we scaled up Alexnet up to a batch size of 8K, and Resnet-50 to a batch size of 32K. for B=8K the accuracy gap was decreased from 14% to 2.2%. if the ratio between the norm of the layer weights and norm of gradients update is too high, the versiuneversiuneversiuneversiuneversiuneversiuneversiuneversiuneversiuneversiuneversiuneversiuneversiuneversiuneversiune............................................................................. LARS uses a separate learning rate for each layer and not for each weight. the magnitude of the update is controlled with respect to the weight norm. with LARS we trained Alexnet-BN and Resnet-50 with B=32K without accuracy loss. if you increase the batch B by k, you should also increase LR by k while keeping other hyper-parameters (momentum, weight decay, etc.) unchanged. if you increase the batch B by k, you should also..................................................................................... the best accuracy for Alexnet-BN with B=4K is 53.1%, achieved for LR=0.05. for B=8K we couldn’t scale-up LR either, and the best accuracy is 44.8%. we conclude that in this case the accuracy loss is not related to a generalization gap, and it is caused by the low training. we replaced Local Response Normalization layers with Batch Normalization (BN). BN significantly widens the range of LRs with good accuracy... ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ the network training for SGD with LARS is summarized in the Algorithm 1. one can consider LARS as a private case of block-diagonal re-scaling. the local LR strongly depends on the layer and batch size (see Figure 2). if the local LR is large compared to the ratio for some layer, then training may become unstable. if the local LR is large compared to the ratio for some layer, then training may become unstable. if the . ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ et al. re-trained Alexnet and Alexnet-BN with LARS for batches up to 32K 6. for B=8K the accuracy of both networks matched the baseline B=512. the state-of-the-art accuracy 75% was achieved with more extensive data augmentation. et al.
