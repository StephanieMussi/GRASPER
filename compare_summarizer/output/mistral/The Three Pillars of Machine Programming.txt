 In this position paper, the authors discuss their vision for the future of machine programming through a three-pillar framework: intention, invention, and adaptation. Machine programming aims to automate software development by enabling machines to understand user intent, discover algorithms, and autonomously evolve software. The opportunity for machine programming ar  This text discusses the three pillars of machine programming: Invention, Adaptation, and Execution. Invention involves discovering algorithms to solve problems, with search-based techniques and deductive synthesis being major approaches. Machine learning is also explored as a new direction for invention. Adaptation focuses  This text discusses machine programming systems and their relationship with the three pillars of intention, invention, and adaptation. Machine programming involves computers creating software with minimal human intervention. The text introduces the concept of verified lifting as an example of how these pillars interplay in machine programming. Verified lifting is a process that  This list includes research papers and publications on various topics related to programming, software development, and computer science. Some of these areas include quantum chemistry code synthesis (Sadayappan et al., 2002), autonomously creating software programs using genetic algorithms (Becker & Gottschlich,   This list includes research papers and technical reports on various topics related to programming, including type-based semantic code search (Mishne et al., 2012), inductive logic programming (Muggleton, 1991), Bayesian sketch learning for program synthesis (Murali  These references describe various research papers related to software engineering, linear algebra, programming, and natural language processing. Here's a summary of each paper:

[79] Whaley and Dongarra (1998) introduced Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software in the Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing. They presented an automatic tuning system for linear algebra software to optimize performance.

[80] Xiong et al. (2017) discussed Precise Condition Synthesis for Program Repair at ICSE '17. They proposed a method to generate precise conditions for program repair, improving the effectiveness of automated bug fixing.

[81] Xu et al. (2017) presented SQLNet, a system that generates structured queries from natural language without reinforcement learning in CoRR abs/1711.04436. This paper aimed to simplify querying databases using natural language.

[82] Yadid and Yahav (2016) extracted code from programming tutorial videos at the ACM International Symposium on New Ideas, New Paradigms, and Reflections on Programming and Software (Onward! 2016). They developed a system to automatically extract code snippets from video tutorials.

[83] Yaghmazadeh et al. (2017) introduced SQLizer, which synthesizes queries from natural language at PACMPL 1, OOPSLA (2017). They proposed a method to generate SQL queries directly from natural language input.

[84] Zheng et al. (2017) presented Opaque, an oblivious and encrypted distributed analytics platform in the 14th USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation, NSDI 2017. They aimed to provide privacy-preserving data analysis using encryption techniques.
