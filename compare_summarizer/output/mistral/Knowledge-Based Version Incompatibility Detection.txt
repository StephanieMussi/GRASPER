 Decide is a tool for detecting version compatibility issues in deep learning (DL) projects. It identifies components in five DL stack layers: library, runtime, driver, OS/Container, and hardware. Decide uses different methods to gather version information depending on the local environment. For native Python environments, it  Decide is a knowledge-based approach for detecting version incompatibilities in deep learning projects using Stack Overflow discussions. It uses a pre-trained Question-Answering (QA) model to extract version compatibility knowledge from online discussions, enabling it to reason about the deep semantics in natural language  This text is primarily composed of references from various research papers and articles related to dependency management in software development, specifically focusing on deep learning libraries and Python environments. The papers cover topics such as finding build dependency errors (Gang Fan et al., 2018), understanding evolution-induced compatibility issues (Dongjie He et al., 2018), and automatic inference of environment dependencies for Python code snippets (Eric Horton and Chris Parnin, 2019). Other papers discuss taxonomies of real faults in deep learning systems (Nargiz Humbatova et al., 2019) and generating query-specific class API summaries (Mingwei Liu et al., 2019).

Additionally, there are references to articles on Stack Overflow, such as installing older versions of TensorFlow GPU (FlyingTeller, 2019), and research on improving API caveats accessibility by mining API caveats knowledge graph (Hongwei Li et al., 2018). Other papers discuss topics like conflict resolution between JavaScript libraries (Jibesh Patra et al., 2018) and learning transferable visual models from natural language supervision (Alec Radford et al., 2021).

Furthermore, there are references to conferences such as ESEC/FSE '23, ICSE, ASE, ICSME, and CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. The text also mentions several organizations like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and IEEE.

In summary, this text is a collection of references to research papers and articles related to dependency management in software development, specifically focusing on deep learning libraries and Python environments. The papers cover various topics such as error detection, compatibility issues, and automatic dependency inference.
