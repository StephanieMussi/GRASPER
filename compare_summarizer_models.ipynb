Yixin Fei: We address the problem of generalized category discovery (GCD) in this paper, i.e. leveraging the information from a set of seen classes. We present a novel method called Expert-Contrastive Learning. -                sion problems where large-scale human annotations are available, such as image recogni-                tion [5] and object detection [23]. However, collecting a dataset at scales like ImageNet or COCO is not always possible. Consider the scenario of ﬁne-grained recognition such as birdspecies recognition or medical image analysis, where the annotations require expert knowl-                edge which could be costly to collect. In ﬁne-grained category discovery, the main challenge is the large inter-class similarity and intra-classvariance. Different classes may require the model to learn more discriminative features to distinguish, e.g., two different birds could only differ in the beak. We observed that an unsupervised representation (e.g. DINO) could cluster the data based on class-irrelevant cues such as the object pose or the background, see the left part of Fig. 1. Based on this observation, we proposed a simple yet effective method to boost the performance of generalized category discovery. relevant cues which can be exploited to design further methods. We validated the effectiveness of our proposed method by setting a new state-of-the-artperformance on seven tested generalized category discovery benchmarks. We proposed a method that can learn discriminative features for ﬁne-grained categorydiscovery by partitioning the data into k sub-datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/YiXXin/XCon. Our focus is to learn representations that can be used to discover novel ﬁne-grained categories within the unlabeled dataset. By creating informative contrastive pairs by partitioning the dataset into k sub-datasets using k-means clustering the DINO [1] pretrained representations, we perform joint contrastive representation learning on each of the partitioned sub- datasets. Compared to previous GCD methods with contrastivelearning, our method shows clear performance improvements. In GCD, the training dataset contains two parts, a labeled dataset Dl and an unlabeled dataset Du. The goal of GCD is to learn a model to categorize the instances in Du by leveraging the information from Dl. We proposed a simple method that partitions the dataset into k sub-datasets by using k-means on self-supervised features to help construct Informative contrastive pairs for representations. In this section, we review the method proposed in Vaze et al. [26] for GCD.  supervised contrastivelearning on the labeled data and unsupervised contrastive learning on all the data to avoid pitfalls. The semi-supervised k-means method is proposed. The overall process is similar to the original k-Means method [20] The overall procedure is based on the following assumptions: Images are unlabeled, labels are labeled, and the cluster is close to the nearest cluster centroids. The learning objective is the combination of these two losses. The key challenge in representation learning for ﬁne-grained GCD is that the representa-                tion is required to be sensitive to the detailed discriminative traits of different classes. Learn-ing the model by contrasting between examples in the full dataset may not help the model. Instead, we take advantage of the self-supervised.representations that can roughly cluster the images according to the overall image statistics. (e.g. background, object pose) Each projector can be consid-ered an expert projector dedicated to learning ﬁne-grained discriminative features from each sub-dataset. Similar to Vaze et al. [26], we apply both supervised contrastive loss and self-supervised Contrastive loss to � Lapne-tune the model. The overall loss we propose to learn �apne- grained features is the combination of two losses. We evaluate our method on both generic image classiﬁcation datasets and ﬁne-grained datasets. We split the training data into a labeled data set and an unlabeled dataset. We employ the clustering accuracy (ACC) on the unlabeling set to mea-sure the performance. The results are presented in Table 1 and the evaluation metric is de-listed in the next section. The method is based on the CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-100, and Standford Cars datasets. IFAR10CIFAR100 is a clustering method based on ViT-B-16 [6] as the backbone of our method. We use the Hungarian algorithm [19] to find the best permutation, and N is the number of images in the unlabeled set. We implement the projection heads as three layer MLPs following DINO [1] We use a base learning rate of 0.1 with a cosine annealing schedule and set the batch size to 32. XCon shows the best performance on ‘All’, showing that our method could improve upon previous works. XCon also achieves comparable results with other methods on the other subsets as ‘Old’ and ‘New’ The best performance is achieved by naively running a k-means on DINO features, suggesting that the original features can already represent the unlabeled categories well.

XCon can consistently outperform the baseline(α = 0) with different α. The best result is achieved with α = 0.4 on Cub-200. The effect of the sub-dataset number is illustrated in Ta-reprehensive 6. Although the performance of XCon is consistently. We propose XCon to address the problem of generalized category discovery. We cluster unlabeled data and compare results from the initial model(DINO) with ones from our method (XCon) It is clear that the improvement from DINO to our method is signiﬁcant. better than the baseline’s, it still varies greatly depending on the number of sub-datasets. In contrast to DINO, with our model, we can see clearophobicboundaries between different groups, and each group is corresponding to one certain cate-walletgory in CIFAR10. XCon partitions the dataset into Ksub-dataset using k-means clustering on a self-supervised representation. Experiments on four ﬁne-grained image classiﬁcation benchmarks show clear performance improvements of XCon. The author would like to acknowledge compute support from LunarAI.

We analyze the performance of our method by ﬁne-tuning different pretrained representations of other self- supervised ViT models. We observe that DINO still shows the best performance on clustering the data based on class-irrelevant informations. We compare our estimated number of classes in unlabeled data with the ground truth number of class in unlabelled data in Table 8. We use the class number estimated in Table 8 to evaluate our method. We report the results on generic image classiﬁcation benchmarks in Table 9. With our estimated class number, our method performs better on Standford-Cars and also reaches comparable results on the other datasets except CIFAR10. We further ablate the components of contrastive loss in Table 11. We show that only with 0, the ACC drops 21.5 −23.6% on CUB-200.

            "we present a novel method called Expert-Contrastive Learning (XCon) to help the model to learn fine-grained discriminative features from the images. deep learning models have achieved super-human performance on many computer vi- sion problems. our method is based on the results of deep learning experiments on fine-grained datasets. it is hoped that deep learning will be able to improve the accuracy of deep learning models. the problem of generalized category discovery was recently formalized in [26]. aim is to discover categories within the unlabeled data by leveraging the information  2022. the copyright of this document resides with its authors. it may be distributed unchanged freely in print or electronic forms. cs.v:2208.01898v1 [cs.CV] 3 Aug 2022 2 Y. FEI ET AL. field experts are interested in the fine-grained concepts in real applications. we propose a method that can learn discriminative features for fine-grained category discovery. we partition the data into k expert sub-datasets by directly performing k-means clustering on self-supervised representations. the method can be used as a strong prior for the next learning phase, if the data is not labeled, we say. our code is available at https://github.com/YiXXin/XCon. NCD aims to discover new object categories by transferring the knowledge learned from a set of relevant but different seen classes. a common three- step learning pipeline is proposed in RankStat [9], where the representation is first learned with self-supervision on all the data and then fine-tuned on the labeled data. our method is effective for learning representations using instance discrimination. it pushes negative examples away from each other and pulls positive examples closer. compared to previous methods with contrastive learning, our method shows clear performance improvements. compared to previous methods with contrastive learning, our method shows clear performance improvements. back to mail online home. back to the page you came from and are you familiar with this article? share your thoughts with cnn ireport. the goal of GCD is to learn a model to categorize the instances in Du. self-supervised ViT features [1] could be a good initialization for representation learning. k-means on self-supervised features could help construct informative contrastive pairs for representations. the method proposed in vaze et al. [26] for GCD consists of two parts, representation learning and class assignment. Fig. 2. learn- ing the model by contrasting between examples in the full dataset may not help the model to learn such a discriminative representation. we take advantage of the self-supervised representations that can roughly cluster the images according to the overall image statistics. the model will naturally learn fine-grained discriminative features to distin- guish between classes. the final learning objective is the combination of these two losses Lcoarse = (1)  iBU BL Lu i + we denote the whole training set as D = (xi,yi). the feature vi = f(xi) is extracted from each image xi. the whole D is clustered into K sub-datasets D1,D2,,DK using k-means. each sub-dataset contains similar images and will be used for fine-grained category discovery later. vi are two views of one same image through data augmentation, and  is the temperature parameter. the overall loss we propose to learn fine-grained features is the combination of two losses. we evaluate our method on both generic image classification datasets and fine- grained datasets. we split the training data into a labeled image and run the semi-supervised k-means algorithm to obtain the cluster assignments of each sample. d dataset and an unlabeled dataset by first dividing all classes equally into a seen class set and an unseen one. then sampling 50% images from the seen classes as unlabeled data so that the labeled set Du contains images from both seen classes and unseen classes. the evaluation metric is defined as below pP(yu) 1 N N  i=1 1yi = p(  yi) (8) Y. the batch size for the entire training dataset is set to 256 and the batch size of all the sub-datasets is set to 32. for the ImageNet dataset, all models are trained for 60 epochs while for other datasets, models are trained for 200 epochs. for a fair comparison with existing methods, we use the same semi-supervised k-means method as [26] to do the evaluation.

XCon can consistently outperform the baseline( = 0) with different weight . we visualize the feature spaces with TSNE on CIFAR10 by mapping the features into two dimensions for a more direct qualitative analysis. the improvement from DINO to our method is significant. with our model, we can see clear boundaries between different groups, and each group is corresponding to one certain cate- gorical class. XCon first partitions the dataset into K sub-dataset using k-means clustering on a self-supervised representation. Xinlei Chen, Saining Xie, and Kaiming He.

However, collecting a dataset at scales like ImageNet or UNCLASSIFIEDCOCO is not always possible. Consider the scenario of ﬁne-grained recognition such as bird-species recognition or medical image analysis, where the annotations require expert knowl-edge which could be costly to collect, also it is difﬁcult for the collected annotations to coverall the possible classes because new classes keep growing over time.-The problem of generalized category discovery was recently formalized in [26], where the aim is to discover categories within the unlabeled data by leveraging the information gleaned by human experts.This document is Copyright© 2022. The copyright of this document resides with its authors. It may be distributed unchanged ﬁne-grained generalized category discovery is a more complex and practical problem than generic category discovery since ﬁeld experts in the fieldare interested in the ﬁne-grained concepts in real applications, and they often have a labeled sub-dataset representing the existing knowledge, so such a ﬁne-grained generalized category-discovery method could help them make sense of the unlabeled set by clustering the unla-beled instance according to the criteria implicitly deﬁned in the labeled data. In ﬁne-grained generalized category-category discovery, the main challenge is the large inter-class similarity and the intra-class-irrelevant cues. Because of the inter-variance, different classes may require the model to learn more discriminative features to be able to distinguish, relevant cues which can be exploited to design further methods. Additionally,• We proposed a method that can learn discriminative features for ﬁne-grained category-discovery by partitioning the data into k sub-datasets. Additionally,• We validated the effectiveness of our proposed method by setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark to demonstrate highperformance on seven tested generalized category discovery benchmarks.Our code is available at https://github.com/YiXXin/XCon.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. 29]. Additionally,Our work also builds on a newly proposed setting named Generalized Category Discov-grivelery (GCD) [26] where the unlabeled examples can come from both seen and unseen classes, which is a more realistic scenario than NCD. [2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2.2 0. Each of the partitioned sub-datasets will force the model to encountlearn ﬁne-grained discriminative information, because the background is similar within each of theof the sub-datasets so the model will need to learn the difference on the objects to be able todistinguish the examples.1.1.1.2.3.1.2.3.3.3.1.Methods:In GCD, the training dataset contains two parts, a labeled dataset Dl = {(xl,yu,yu,i,yl,i,yu,i,yu,i,yu,i,yu,i,yu,i,yu,i,yu,i,yu,i,yu,i,yu,i  supervised contrastive loss to avoid overlearning on the labeled data and unsupervised contrastive learning on all the data to avoid overlearning on the labeled data and unsupervised contrastive learning on all the data to avoid overlearning on the labeled data and overoutﬁtting the seen classes.CLASSIFIEDY.

Learn-to-learn discriminative features by contrasting the model by contrasting between examples in the full dataset may not help the model learn-to learn such a discriminative representation. Thus, we take advantage of the self-supervised and self-researchedrepresentations that can roughly cluster the images according to the overall image statistics of each sub-dataset(e.g. background, object pose, etc.) [1] to perform a preprocess on the full dataset by par-titioning it into k expert sub-datasets. The overall statistics within  learning will be performed. Each projector can be consid-administered an expert projector dedicated to learning ﬁne-grained discriminative features from each dataset, and each projector can be consid-sub-dataset. Similar to Vaze et al. [26], we apply both supervised contrastive loss and self-supervised contrastive loss to ﬁne-tune the model.

It can distinguish between two groups, but it can distinguish between two groups greatly depending on the number of sub-datasets. When K = 2, it can reach the high-level of distinguishing between two groups, but the lowest on the ‘Old’ set, but the lowest on the ‘New’ set, that means with two groups, the overalldifference between features is not so great inside each group that the model tends to focus more on the existing coarse-grained knowledge learned from the seen classes.

We initialize the ViT-B-16 model [6] with the parameters pretrained onTextColorImageNet-1k by MoCo v3 for 300 epochs and by MAE for 800 epochs estimated by our method is signiﬁcantly closer to the ground truth compared with GCD [26]. suburOur method tends to show better performance on ﬁne-grained datasets, given that the dataset has little obvious difference between the two classes. Additionally, themethod'spartitioning can help the model learn more discriminative features when facing the more challenginglychallenging datasets that have little obvious difference. suburTable 8: Estimation of the number of classes in unlabeled data. suburCIFAR10 suburCIFAR100 suburImageNet-100 suburCUB-200 suburStandford-Cars suburFGVC-Aircraft suburOxford-Pet suburGround truth subur10 subur10ahime100ahime100 suburGCD [26] suburCIFAR10 suburGCD [26] subur9ahime100 suddenlyAllTextColorOldTextColorNewTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorNewTextColorAllTextColorOld weaponeAllTextColorOld weaponeAllPattyOldTextColorNewTextColorAllShanghaiOld weaponeAllShanghaiOldTextColorAllPattyOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorNewTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllPattyOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllPattyOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOldTextColorAllTextColorOld\n",

            "This paper presents a novel method for learning fine-grained category discovery using expert knowledge from a set of seen classes, where the unlabeled images could contain both seen classes and unseen classes, and Experiments on fine- grained datasets show a clear improved performance over the previous best methods, indicating the effectiveness of our method.<n> Experiments on fine- grained datasets show a clear improved performance over the previous best methods, indicating the effectiveness of our method., Zhixin Fei, Zhongkai Zhao, Siwei Yang, and Bingchen Zhao, \"Expert-Contrastive Learning (XCon)\" The aim of this paper is to develop a method for learning fine-grained generalized category discovery by clustering the un-supervised data set by the criteria implicitly defined in the data set, and to show how this method can be used by experts for the discovery of new classes in the un-supervised data set, and to show how this method can be used by experts for the discovery of new classes in the un-supervised data set, and to show how this method can be used by experts for the discovery of new classes in the un-supervised data set, and to show how this method can be used by experts for the discovery of new classes in the un-supervised data set, and to show how this method can be used by experts for the discovery of new classes in the un-supervised data set, and to show how this method can be used by experts for the discovery of new classes in the un-supervised data set. The performance of general category discovery on fine-grained data can be improved by exploiting self-supervised representations of irrelevant class-irrelevant cues, as we have shown in our previous work [1, 2]. 2 Related Works 2.1 Novel Category Discovery Novel Category Discovery (NCD) aims to discover new categories by transferring the knowledge learned from a set of relevant but different seen classes to a new object, then further fine-tuned using a pair-wise loss on unLabeled data, as we have shown in our previous work [1, 2], and in our present work. In our series of papers on non-labeling (NCD) classification, we have shown that a number of approaches to this problem, such as MixUp and local object parts, have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as instance discrimination and DualRank, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as Contrastive learning, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as DualRank, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as Contrastive learning, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as DualRank, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as Contrastive learning, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as DualRank, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as Contrastive learning, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen other approaches, such as DualRank, which have shown promising results, but we have also seen This paper presents a framework for contrastive learning on the GCD training dataset D1...DK as well as on the full dataset D0. Each of the partitioned sub-datasets model to learn fine-supervised discriminative information on the background because the examples will need to learn the difference on the objects to be able to distinguish the examples. The training dataset D1...DK has been used to train a model to learn fine-grained discriminative information on the background because the examples will need to learn the difference on the objects to be able to distinguish the examples. In this paper, we propose a semi-Supervised GCD model that learns fine-grained discriminative features by combining supervised contrastive losses with supervised contrastive losses in a minibatch of unlabelled images, and then reassigns the labels to the correct cluster based on the new labels in the minibatch, as in the original k-means method [1, 2]), and then computes the supervised contrastive losses in the minibatch as well as the supervised contrastive losses in the original k-means method, which are defined as Ls i =  1 |N(i)|  qN(i) log exp(zi zq/) n 1[n=i] exp(zi zn/) (2) where N(i) is the set of indices of images in the minibatch that have the same label yi with the anchor image i. In this paper, we propose a coarse-grained discriminative training model for image recognition based on a set of expert sub-datasets, each of which is dedicated to learning fine-grained discriminative features from each of the sub-dataset's corresponding images. Specifically, our proposed fine-grained self-supervised contrastive loss is Lu fine =  K  kgrained 1 |Bk|  iBk log exp(hk(vi)hk( vi)/) (4) where Bk is a minibatch of images sampled from a partitioned dataset Dk, vi and  vi are two views of one same image through data augmentation, and  is the temperature parameter. In this paper, we propose a coarse-grained feature learning method to learn fine-grained features from image classification datasets, with a special focus on the performance of the fine- grained image clas- sification datasets, which can be more challenging for GCD methods requiring models to learn highly discriminative features [23,24,25,27,28,29,30,31,32,33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 51, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, 65, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 80, 81, 83, 84, 87, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 98, 99, 103, 104, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, 106, In this paper, we present a semi-supervised method for fine-tuning image classifi- cation methods using ViT-B-16 as the backbone, and we compare it with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results, as well as compare it with existing methods in terms of NC benchmarks and fine-tuning benchmark results.

In this paper, we report the results of a self-supervised model for image classification on six datasets: Standford-Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, Stanford-Cars, MoCo v3, MAE, and CIFAR10 (all in English) and compare our results with those of GCD and  Curimi, as well as on fine-grained datasets such as CIFAR10 and Standford-Cars, and with the results of contrastive fine-tuning benchmarks in Table 7 and Table 10, as well as on generic image classification benchmarks in Table 9 and Table 10.

            "in this paper, we address the problem of generalized category discovery ( gcd ). 1. 1 xcon : introduction to category discovery we present a novel method called expert - contrastive learning to help the model to learn discriminative features from the images. 2. 1 in this case, we present the method of category discovery to the models to the model, where the model can be seen to be an example of a case where the models can be used to mine useful information from the datasets. 3. 1 it is difﬁcult for the model to assume that the collected annotations are accurate and the annotation is accurate, but also it is costly to collect because of the time and expense involved, and it is not possible to collect enough annotates to be accurate, and also it could be expensive to collect. this document resides with its authors, where the author is the author of this document, and the authors are the authors. the authors reside with their authors, and this document is distributed unchanged by the authors, as well as by their authors. from a set of labeled datasets. see the left part of fig. 1. we have ob - served this observation by observing that an unsupervised representation ( ) could group the data based on class y, see the right part of figure 1. see also : we have observed that an object pose such as the object pose and the background. see the bottom part of the data. see our left part. see this part of our data see. see that the data see this side of the table. see left part : see left of data see left side of fig 1. our proposed xcon method we proposed our proposed method, we proposed a method that can be used as a strong prior prior to the next learning phase. these k sub - datasets can be viewed as the starting point for the next dataset. this dataset can be seen as a good prior prior. this is a good starting point because each of these k data - sets will be able to be used to learn a robust representation. this means that each to categorize the unseen classes further. a new scenario is proposed under this ncd problem where the representation is used for contrastive learning. the representation has been shown to be effective under this problem. a common three - step learning pipeline is proposed to be used under this situation. this problem has been proposed under the unlabeled dataset, and then further developed using a pair - wise clustering loss using the pairwise clustering - loss on the labeled dataset and then is further refined using the two - step training pipeline. the representations are then further learned using the representation as the representation. this is the problem under which many works [ 4, 7, 9 ]. this work has shown promising results under this dataset. this data set has shown strong performance under this challenge. our work has been focused on this problem, showing strong performance. our focus is to explore this problem under this case, showing that this problem is a very challenging one. we focus on the ncd situation. our our method shows clear performance improvements. 4 methods in our method using our method with contrastive learning, our method has shown clear performance improvement. our methods show clear performance gains. 3 methods in gcd, the method of our method uses our method to learn more discriminative features. our method, using contrastive representation learning [ 26 ]. 5 methods in the ﬁne - grained, we ﬁrst partitioned the dataset using a partitioned dataset, then we perform joint contrastive representations learning on the full dataset for the gcd dataset, we proposed a method that uses k - means on features to help construct a classiﬁcation setting where the model needs to learn about categories. for representation learning, we propose to use the method proposed in the previous section of our framework, we presented a simple method that we proposed to use for the representation learning setting. for class learning setting, we review the method that is proposed in vaze et al. [ 26 ], for gcd, the method is proposed to be implemented in the following section, representation learning and class assignment : class assignment and representation learning : representation learning is proposed. for the class assignment, vaze [ 25 ] proposes to perform the representation by performing representation learning on the labeled data by performing in each step to recompute the assignment, the model is aware of the fact that the cluster assignment was made in dl regardless of the distance to the nearest cluster centroids regardless of its distance to dl, and thus, the sample will be assigned to the correct cluster regardless of how close it is to dl or dl. 3. 3 learning discrimina - tions to the full dataset may not help the model to learn to be sensitive to such a representation. thus, we take advantage of the self - supervised representations to perform a preprocess on each example within each of the images within each example, we use the model by performing a prepa - tion on the whole dataset, we perform a par - tition on each image, and then we use it to learn - ing the models to learn a representation to learna - ing different classes of different classes. then, we expect the model will naturally learn to differentiate between different class - irrelevant cues represented by different classes - irrelevant each projector can be consid - ered an expert projector dedicated to learning ﬁne - tuned features from each sub - dataset. we apply both of these approaches to learn the model. we use both methods to learn a model. each modelor can also be dedicated to learn discriminant features. speci - erly, we apply the model to learn from the datasets. as a result, we propose to apply both supervised contrastive loss and self - supervised contrastion loss, respectively. we propose that the model should be modeled as follows : following previous works, we choose as the generic image classiﬁcation datasets as the image classesi -cations. we choose cifar - 10 / 100 as the images classi ﬁcations, and we choose to use cifar100 / 100 for the generic class classi classifier data, as the general classi - cessions. for example, we chose to use scars pet as the pet category. these categories contain categories from the same entry level classes, e. g., birds and pet. for pet we choose scars pet, and pet pet. these ﬁne - grained ﬁnes contain categories that contain the same categories. this can be challenging for models requiring models to learn highly discriminative features, including 4. 2 implementation details we follow the implementation of [ 26 ] to implement our method. we follow it to the letter to use as the backbone of our method to use. we use vit - b - 16 [ 6 ] to use it to ﬁne - tune the ﬁnal transformer block while cu \\ cl is frozen while other blocks are frozen while others are frozen, other blocks will be frozen while testing. we only ﬁneﬁne the model while other models are frozen. we ﬁnd the model with the parameters pretrained by dino [ 1 ] on imagenet and only use the model when testing, we ﬁne the training datasets to be trained for 60 epochs. we set α to be 0. 1 by default. for our method, we use the following methods : we set the training parameters to be set to 0. 5 by default and we set our method can best preserve the original fea - tures, suggesting that unlike ex - isting method potentially introducing damage to original features which results in performance drop, our method is best preserving the original features of original categories well, showing that by using our method to preserve original features, whereas ex - ex isting methods can best protect original features and original features. our method shows the best performance on all four datasets we tested, we show that our method showed the best results on the all dataset, while achieving comparable results on ‘ all ’ dataset while achieving similar results on old dataset. we present the results on category discovery dataset i. e. cub -

            "The paper \"XCon: Learning with Experts for Fine-grained Category Discovery\" by Yixin Fei et al. introduces a novel approach to address the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). GCD aims to cluster unlabeled images by leveraging information from a set of seen (labeled) classes, a task especially challenging within fine-grained datasets where classes are highly similar to one another. Traditional methods struggle with large inter-class similarities and intra-class variances, often leading to suboptimal performance due to irrelevant cues being used for classification. The proposed solution, Expert-Contrastive Learning (XCon), enhances the model's ability to discern fine-grained discriminative features by initially partitioning the dataset into sub-datasets using k-means clustering and subsequently applying contrastive learning within these partitions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Introduction\n",
            "With the advent of deep learning, there's been significant progress in computer vision tasks where large-scale annotated data is available. However, collecting and annotating such datasets, especially for fine-grained recognition tasks (e.g., bird species identification), remains a challenge due to the expertise required and the continuous emergence of new classes. To mitigate the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, the concept of generalized category discovery (GCD) has been proposed. Unlike semi-supervised learning, GCD does not presume knowledge of all classes in the dataset, making it a more challenging yet practical task.\n",
            "\n",
            "XCon focuses on fine-grained GCD, aiming to leverage labeled datasets representing known knowledge to categorize unlabeled instances based on the implicit criteria set by the labeled data. This approach addresses the challenge posed by the high similarity between different classes and the variability within the same class in fine-grained datasets.\n",
            "\n",
            "Related Works\n",
            "The task of Novel Category Discovery (NCD) closely aligns with XCon's objectives. Earlier works in NCD have utilized transfer learning and self-supervision techniques to categorize unseen classes based on knowledge transferred from seen classes. Contrastive learning, a method to learn representations by contrasting positive pairs against negative ones, has shown promise in NCD tasks. However, its effectiveness in fine-grained classification, where XCon is focused, is limited due to the nuanced differences between classes that require more discriminative feature learning.\n",
            "\n",
            "Methodology\n",
            "XCon partitions the dataset into several sub-datasets (referred to as expert datasets) using k-means clustering on self-supervised representations. This partitioning is based on the insight that class-irrelevant cues (like background or object pose) can lead to misleading clustering, thus, by creating more homogenized sub-datasets, the model is compelled to learn finer distinctions between classes.\n",
            "\n",
            "The learning process involves both supervised and unsupervised contrastive learning across the full dataset and within the sub-datasets. The losses from these learning processes are combined to form the model's final optimization objective. This dual approach allows XCon to learn from both coarse-grained (overall dataset) and fine-grained (sub-dataset) features.\n",
            "\n",
            "Experiments and Results\n",
            "The effectiveness of XCon was evaluated on various datasets, including CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-100, CUB-200, Stanford Cars, FGVC-Aircraft, and Oxford-IIIT Pet. These datasets encompass a wide range of classification challenges, from generic to fine-grained categories. XCon achieved state-of-the-art performance on several fine-grained category discovery benchmarks, demonstrating its capability to enhance classification performance significantly in challenging datasets.\n",
            "\n",
            "The implementation details include using a ViT-B-16 model initialized with DINO-pretrained parameters and fine-tuning the final transformer block. The model was trained with a combination of supervised and unsupervised contrastive losses, with the projections heads being discarded post-training.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ablation Studies\n",
            "Ablation studies were conducted to validate the effectiveness of various components of XCon, including the impact of the weight of fine-grained loss and the number of sub-datasets. These studies confirmed the robustness of the XCon approach across different configurations and provided insights into optimal settings for different datasets.\n",
            "\n",
            "Conclusion\n",
            "XCon introduces a novel method for fine-grained category discovery by leveraging expert sub-datasets and a combination of contrastive learning approaches. Its success across various benchmarks signifies a significant advancement in the field, offering a new direction for research in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning within fine-grained classification scenarios. The method's codebase has been made publicly available, encouraging further exploration and adaptation of this approach within the research community.\n"
