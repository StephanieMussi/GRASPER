Slide 1: Introduction to XCon
XCon: Learning with Experts for Fine-grained Category Discovery.
Addressing the challenge of generalized category discovery (GCD) leveraging seen class information.
Introduction of Expert-Contrastive Learning as a novel method.
Motivation: The difficulty in collecting large-scale, fine-grained datasets like ImageNet or COCO due to the need for expert annotations.

Slide 2: Challenges in Fine-grained Category Discovery
Main challenge: High inter-class similarity and intra-class variance in fine-grained categories.
Example: Differentiating bird species based on subtle features like beak shape.
Limitation of unsupervised representations clustering data on irrelevant cues (e.g., background or object pose).

Slide 3: XCon Methodology Overview
Proposal of partitioning data into k sub-datasets using k-means clustering on DINO pretrained representations.
Execution of joint contrastive representation learning on each partitioned sub-dataset.
Improvement over traditional GCD methods with a focus on constructing informative contrastive pairs.

Slide 4: Learning Objective and Process
Detailed review of the semi-supervised k-means method for dataset partitioning.
The learning objective combines supervised and unsupervised contrastive learning.
Emphasis on the necessity of fine-grained discriminative trait sensitivity in representation learning.

Slide 5: Implementation and Results
Method validation on seven generalized category discovery benchmarks, setting new performance records.
Clustering accuracy (ACC) employed as the primary performance metric.
Achievements on CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars datasets with significant ACC improvements.

Slide 6: Model Fine-tuning and Evaluation
Utilization of contrastive loss adjustments to fine-tune the model for optimal fine-grained feature learning.
Performance evaluation based on both generic and fine-grained image classification datasets.
Ablation study insights indicating the effectiveness of various method components.

Slide 7: Conclusion and Contributions
XCon significantly enhances generalized category discovery, overcoming traditional GCD method limitations.
Clear performance advancements on fine-grained image classification benchmarks.
